// This file implements spec §6's #1 practical failure mitigation: "Worker crash leaks
// VMs — Per-VM cgroup under a systemd slice the unit owns; systemd kills the control
// group. On start, sweep the slice for orphans from a previous incarnation."
//
// ARM-AGNOSTIC BY DESIGN (hardware-corrections D3): the cgroup-CREATION mechanism is
// per-arm — Firecracker's jailer makes one via --cgroup/--parent-cgroup/--cgroup-version
// (see firecrackerCgroupArgs in launcher_firecracker.go); Cloud Hypervisor has no jailer
// equivalent, so its launcher places the VMM in a `systemd-run --scope` instead (see
// launcher_chv.go). But SweepOrphans and vmCgroupPath below only ever walk directories
// and read/write the two files (cgroup.procs, memory.max) that both mechanisms produce
// under the SAME parent slice (spec §5.3). Neither function contains one line that knows
// which VMM made a given subdirectory — that is the whole point: one sweep, at worker
// start, covers whatever either arm left behind, including a mix of both across restarts
// where SH_VMM was changed.
//
// D8 (comm-truncation trap): this sweep kills by reading pids out of cgroup.procs, never
// by matching a process name. That is not just simpler — it is the only form of this that
// works for both arms at all, since cloud-hypervisor's 16-character name is truncated to
// 15 by the kernel's TASK_COMM_LEN, so `pgrep/pkill -x cloud-hypervisor` never matches
// (firecracker's 11-character name is unaffected, which is exactly why this trap survives
// review — it silently breaks one arm while the other keeps working). Reading
// cgroup.procs sidesteps the name entirely.
//
// H1 (final whole-branch review): "walk directories" is NOT "walk every directory".
// deploy/microvm/microvm-worker.service sets Slice=microvm-vms.slice, and systemd nests
// a unit assigned to a slice beneath that slice in the cgroup tree (systemd.slice(5) —
// the same shape as system.slice/sshd.service), so the slice's immediate children are:
//
//	/sys/fs/cgroup/microvm-vms.slice/
//	├── microvm-worker.service/   <-- cgroup.procs holds the SWEEPING PROCESS's own pid
//	├── vm-9/                     <-- Firecracker: jailer --id/--parent-cgroup/--cgroup
//	└── vm-vm-9.scope/            <-- Cloud Hypervisor: systemd-run --scope --slice=
//
// The original sweep's only filter was entry.IsDir(), so it read its own pid out of
// microvm-worker.service/cgroup.procs and SIGKILLed itself, every RestartSec=5s,
// forever. Three independent guards now stand between this function and that outcome,
// deliberately overlapping — a directory filter alone is exactly what was wrong before,
// so it is not made the only thing that has to be right:
//
//  1. isPoolVMCgroupDirName is an ALLOWLIST of the names THIS POOL creates, derived from
//     nextIDLocked and chvScopeUnitName rather than retyped. Anything else is skipped and
//     REPORTED (SweepResult.Skipped), never swept hopefully. Fail-closed beats
//     sweep-anything: a sweep that kills the wrong cgroup is worse than one that leaves
//     debris a human can see named in a log line.
//  2. sliceHoldsCallersOwnCgroup / callersOwnCgroupDir refuses any directory that IS the
//     caller's own cgroup or an ancestor of it, derived from /proc/self/cgroup — the
//     kernel's own answer — rather than by assuming the unit is called
//     "microvm-worker.service". That assumption is precisely the class of premise that
//     produced H1.
//  3. unsafeToSignal refuses, at the pid layer, the caller's own pid, its
//     process-group leader, and kill(2)'s wildcards 0 and -1. Both launchers Setpgid
//     their VMM into its own process group (fcIsolateProcessGroup,
//     chvIsolateAndDropPrivileges), and an orphan from a PREVIOUS incarnation cannot be
//     in this process's group at all, so nothing this sweep legitimately targets is ever
//     refused by that rule.
//
// The complementary risk — a filter so strict the sweep silently becomes a no-op, which
// reintroduces the orphan leak §6 lists first — is covered by
// TestSweepOrphansSparesTheWorkersOwnCgroupAndStillKillsAVMOrphan asserting BOTH halves
// (the worker's pid survives AND a real VM-shaped orphan's pid dies) in one test, and by
// TestSweepOrphansRecognisesBothArmsCgroupNames pinning the allowlist against the pool's
// own id generator instead of against literals.
//
// D9 (tmpfs-vs-persistent asymmetry): this sweep relies on cgroup.procs, which is a live
// kernel view with no staleness window at all — cgroupfs is not backed by disk and holds
// no state across a reboot for the sweep to misread, unlike a self-maintained PID file
// under /run that Task 16's RunDir reasoning depends on being reboot-cleared. Given that,
// this sweep intentionally does NOT also walk the Firecracker jail directories under
// SH_CHROOT_BASE (default /srv/jail, NOT reboot-cleared per D9) — a leftover jail
// directory is expected debris from a normal Destroy that failed partway, not evidence of
// a live process, and removing it blind on every worker start risks deleting a jail that
// a *different*, still-running worker incarnation legitimately owns during a rolling
// restart. Cleaning stale jail directories is a candidate for a separate, explicitly
// time-based reaper, not this crash-recovery sweep.

// vmCgroupPath returns the cgroup directory for one VM under the given parent slice.
// Firecracker's jailer is configured with the identical parent via --parent-cgroup
// (firecrackerCgroupArgs), and the Cloud Hypervisor launcher's systemd-run --scope is
// placed under the same slice — spec §5.3: "they must be configured consistently... or
// the two mechanisms fight and the leak we are preventing returns." A path outside the
// parent would escape systemd's KillMode=control-group on the unit.
func vmCgroupPath(parent, id string) string {
	return filepath.Join(parent, id)
}

// The three names below are the single authority on what a VM's cgroup DIRECTORY is
// called under the parent slice. They live together, in the file that has to recognise
// them, because H1 was a false premise about exactly this — and they are consumed rather
// than duplicated: pool.nextIDLocked builds every VM id from vmIDPrefix, and
// launcher_chv.go's Restore names its systemd scope with chvScopeUnitName. Spec §5.3's
// "two numbers that can drift is the bug" applies to a name just as much as to a byte
// count, and the drift here is silent in the worst direction: the sweep would keep
// returning 0 swept while VMs leaked.
const (
	// vmIDPrefix prefixes every pool-generated VM id ("vm-" + a decimal sequence
	// number). The Firecracker arm's cgroup directory IS that id: jailer, given
	// --cgroup, "will create a new cgroup named <id> for the microvm in the
	// <cgroup_base>/<parent_cgroup> subfolder" (firecracker docs/jailer.md), so
	// --parent-cgroup replaces the exec-file-name default entirely and the VM cgroup is
	// an immediate child of the slice.
	vmIDPrefix = "vm-"

	// --unit=` name, which systemd materialises as "<unit>" + chvScopeDirSuffix under
	// --slice.
	chvScopeUnitPrefix = "vm-"

	// chvScopeDirSuffix is the suffix systemd gives a scope unit's cgroup directory.
	chvScopeDirSuffix = ".scope"

	// Cgroup2Root is where the unified hierarchy is mounted. SH_PARENT_CGROUP is

	Cgroup2Root = "/sys/fs/cgroup"

	// DefaultParentCgroup is the ONE default both consumers share, so they cannot
	// drift apart again. It is deliberately slice-RELATIVE and deliberately spells the
	// full systemd hierarchy, because both of those were wrong before and each was
	// wrong in a way that looked right:
	//
	// Verified on hardware (m8i.xlarge, jailer v1.17.0, cgroup v2), three ways:

	//	    REFUSED: "Parent cgroup path is invalid. Path should not be absolute or
	//	    contain '..' or '.'" / CgroupInvalidParentPath. No cgroup created. So an
	//	    absolute value can never work for the Firecracker arm, however correct the
	//	    path is — which is why ValidateParentCgroup refuses one at start.
	//	--parent-cgroup microvm-vms.slice
	//	    Created /sys/fs/cgroup/microvm-vms.slice/vm-N — a NEW TOP-LEVEL cgroup
	//	    OUTSIDE systemd's slice. memory.max was set on it, so it looked correct,
	//	    while the slice's own accounting and limits covered none of it and a sweep
	//	    pointed at the systemd slice could never see it.
	//	--parent-cgroup microvm.slice/microvm-vms.slice
	//	    Created /sys/fs/cgroup/microvm.slice/microvm-vms.slice/vm-N, inside the
	//	    slice, memory.max correct. This one.
	//
	// The two-segment form is not redundancy: systemd expands a DASHED slice name into
	// a hierarchy, so the unit "microvm-vms.slice" lives at
	// microvm.slice/microvm-vms.slice. `systemctl show microvm-vms.slice -p

// fails loudly (a clear error, not a missing symbol) if ever reached. Windows is not a
// deployment target for this project — nothing here is claiming otherwise — but a
// package that fails to compile on an unlisted platform is a worse, more surprising
// failure mode than one that compiles everywhere and only refuses to *run* where it
// cannot.

// waitForCgroupEmpty polls dir's cgroup.procs briefly so the kernel has a chance to
// finish tearing down a just-killed process before rmdir is attempted — rmdir on a
// cgroup that still has a member (even a zombie draining) fails. This is best-effort:
// SweepOrphans' own rmdir error, if any, is what ultimately surfaces a stuck cgroup, not
// this helper.
