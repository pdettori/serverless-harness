// This file is the Firecracker arm of Launcher (spec §4.3, §5.3). Two things about
// it are load-bearing enough to say once, here, rather than repeat at every call
// site:
//
// PROCESS LIFETIME. The jailer/firecracker process Restore starts must outlive the
// context Restore itself was called with — that ctx is a per-warm or per-Probe
// context that is cancelled the moment THAT call returns, long before the VM it
// created is done being useful. So Restore uses exec.Command, never
// exec.CommandContext, for that one process, and hands the *exec.Cmd to the
// returned VM so Destroy (deferred unconditionally by every caller, per
// pool.go's ExecPhased) is what ends its life, not ctx cancellation.
//
// TWO CONFIRMED GAPS THIS TASK DOES NOT CLOSE. deploy/microvm/build-snapshot.sh
// (a) runs firecracker directly, unjailed, and records the rootfs drive's
// path_on_host as an absolute path inside a `mktemp -d` staging directory that is
// deleted (`trap 'rm -rf "$STAGE"' EXIT`) once the build finishes, and (b) never
// configures a second (workspace) drive at all — there is no PUT /drives/workspace
// call anywhere in it. Firecracker's snapshot/load API has no restore-time
// override for a drive's path_on_host (unlike vsock, which has vsock_override —
// see fcapi.go) or for an absent device, so this launcher cannot make either gap
// disappear from inside Restore. What it does instead: hardlink every snapshot
// component AND workspace.img into the jail at the FIXED, jail-relative paths a
// FIXED build script would need to have recorded in vmstate for LoadSnapshot to
// find them (see Restore's comments below for exactly which paths). Until
// build-snapshot.sh is changed to build under that same convention, restoring a
// snapshot the CURRENT script produced will fail at LoadSnapshot with a
// fault_message naming the missing/wrong path — loudly, not silently. See the
// task-15 report for the full writeup; this is a blocker for whichever task owns
// the build pipeline next, not something Task 15's interface work can paper over.

// It replaced a fixed 20 ms sleep, which was a measurement FLOOR: no restore could observe its
// socket sooner than one quantum, so min was 20.06 ms over 1,625 restores with zero below it
// (78.2% in [20,40), 21.8% in [40,60)).
//
// What removing that floor was worth is now measured, and it is much less than #304 predicted.
// On srv-r16b14s16 the mean went 24.92 -> 22.24 ms and the restore 27.73 -> 25.09 ms, about
// 11%. The earlier reasoning -- sockwait is 90% of a restore over 2.80 ms of real work, so the
// socket must appear in single-digit ms and we are merely sleeping past it -- was an INFERENCE
// the old data could not support: at 20 ms granularity "appears at 2 ms" and "appears at 19 ms"
// are the same reading. With fine polling the true distribution is visible and the socket
// genuinely takes ~10-40 ms to bind on this host, centred near 21 ms. The quantum happened to
// sit close to the real cost.
//
// So sockwait remains ~89% of a restore, and that residue is Firecracker's startup, which no
// poll change reaches. Do NOT read this constant block as having removed a throughput ceiling.
//
// RESIDUAL RESOLUTION, which bounds any attribution drawn from sockwait. The schedule from
// socketPollMin at socketPollGrowthNum/Den is:
//
//	attempt  1 dials at t=0        then sleeps 250us
//	attempt  5 dials at t=2.03ms   then sleeps 1.27ms
//	attempt  8 dials at t=8.04ms   then sleeps 4.27ms
//	attempt  9 dials at t=12.31ms  <- socketPollMax first applies here
//
// Eight sleeps total 12.31 ms, so the cap governs everything beyond that. At a 5 ms cap the
// measured p50 of ~21 ms therefore carried up to 5 ms of our own sleep -- and the "continuous"
// modes reported at [10,12), [14,16), [20,22), [26,28) were 4-6 ms apart because they WERE that
// comb, not a continuous distribution. The cap is 1 ms so the comb is finer than the thing being
// measured: sockwait is now accurate to about +-1 ms rather than +-5 ms, at ~27 probes to reach
// 25 ms. Raising it again re-inflates every sockwait figure by up to the new cap.
//
