// TestFirecrackerRefusesAJailALiveVMMStillHolds is the second half of the teardown-bulk
// diagnosis (see the ledger). A leaked VMM from an earlier process leaves a LIVE
// listener on its VM id's API socket. waitForUnixSocket DIALS rather than stats — that
// is correct, since Firecracker creates the socket file before accept()ing on it — so a
// leftover live listener reads as a successful restore, and LoadSnapshot then lands on a
// microVM that is already loaded: "not supported after starting the microVM" (400).
//
// Two harms, both fixed by refusing early. The 400 names neither the collision nor the
// leaked id, so it points the reader at the snapshot rather than at the real cause. And
// Restore's own cleanup() then does os.RemoveAll(jailRoot) on the LIVE foreign VM's jail
// while killing only the process group of the jailer IT started — deleting a running
// VM's files and leaving the VM itself alive, which is precisely why the E10 run found a
// leaked firecracker that had supposedly been cleaned up.
//
// A collision can arise from causes no amount of Close-side tidiness can prevent
// (SIGKILL, OOM-kill, a crash), so this guard is not redundant with fixing the leak:
// it is what makes the next run fail honestly instead of hijacking a stranger.
// Since #328 the collision is staged at the JAIL id rather than the VM id, because those are now
// separate namespaces: jailer's --id comes from jailPool and the first mint is jail-0, while vm-6
// stays the VM's identity in the error, the sweep and the logs. The property under test is
// unchanged -- Restore must refuse rather than hijack a stranger's microVM and then delete its
// files -- and the refusal now comes from jailPool.acquire, which asks the same question, the same
// way, BEFORE it strips the jail. It has to ask first: stripping deletes run/, and with it exactly
// the live socket this test guards.
