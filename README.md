Serverless Harness turns a long-lived AI agent into a **scale-to-zero workload** on Kubernetes.
An agent process normally has to stay resident — holding its conversation, tool state, and working
directory in memory — even while it sits idle waiting for the next turn or for a human to approve a
step. That idle time is pure cost. The harness decouples the agent's **state** (durable in Redis)
and its **tool execution** (an isolated sandbox pod) from the **agent process** itself, so the agent
runs as a Knative service that drops to zero pods when idle and cold-starts with full session
continuity on the next request.

The result is a **leaf-session backend**: an external orchestrator dispatches isolated units of agent
work ("leaves") over a simple HTTP + shared-volume contract, and the harness runs each one
sync, async (queued), scheduled, or paused-for-approval — all on infrastructure that costs nothing at
rest.

## Why

| Persistent agent                                    | Serverless Harness                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Process stays resident between turns                | Scales to **zero** when idle, cold-starts in sub-second               |
| State lives in process memory — lost on crash/evict | State lives in **Redis** — survives eviction, restart, and cold start |
| Tools execute in the agent process                  | Tools execute in an **isolated sandbox pod** (brain/hands split)      |
| Idle compute billed continuously                    | **Only Redis + sandbox** stay resident (2 pods at rest)               |
| One invocation model                                | **Four**: sync, async fan-out, scheduled, human-gated                 |

In an idle-heavy workload [experiment](deploy/knative/EXPERIMENTS.md), the serverless path consumed
roughly **a quarter** of the pod-seconds of an equivalent always-on agent — because the expensive
part (the agent process) exists only while a turn is actively running.

| **Knative Service** | Scale-to-zero HTTP endpoint; runs a turn inline (sync) or enqueues it (async)         |
| **Redis**           | Durable session state (resume by `sessionId`), work queue (Streams), gate state       |
| **KEDA ScaledJob**  | Autoscales `leaf-worker` pods 0→N on queue depth (`lagCount` + `pendingEntriesCount`) |
| **sandbox-0**       | Persistent pod where all tool/code execution runs; reached via `kubectl exec`         |
| **Shared PVC**      | Volume-envelope contract — inputs, results, and markers travel as files               |
| **CronJob**         | Scheduled dispatch (`cron-dispatch`) for periodic batch work                          |

> **Note:** The Knative Service and the `leaf-worker` are the **same container image** with two entry
> points (`server.ts` vs `leaf-job.ts`). Both converge on `runLeaf()`, which routes execution into
> `sandbox-0`. The "brain" (model inference + session logic) runs in whichever pod called `runLeaf()`;
> the "hands" (actual command/tool execution) always run in the sandbox.

## Features

- **Scale-to-zero turns** — Knative drops the agent to zero pods between turns; the activator
  cold-starts a fresh pod on the next request.
- **Durable resume** — sessions are append-only logs in Redis; a cold-started pod recalls full
  conversation and state by `sessionId`, surviving pod eviction.
- **Brain/hands isolation** — the agent never executes tools in its own process; everything runs in a
  separate hardened `sandbox-0` pod via a persistent in-pod channel.
- **Four dispatch modes** — one `/runs` endpoint serves sync, async-queued, cron-scheduled, and
  human-gated execution (see [Dispatch Archetypes](#dispatch-archetypes)).
- **Human-in-the-loop gates** — a leaf can pause mid-run, report `awaiting_approval`, and resume on an
  external approve/reject/abort verdict — scaling to zero while it waits.
- **Volume-envelope contract** — orchestrators pass inputs and collect results as files on a shared
  PVC, decoupling result size from HTTP limits.
- **Hardened by default** — non-root UID, read-only root filesystem, all capabilities dropped,
  `RuntimeDefault` seccomp, no service-account token automount.
- **Built on Pi** — wraps a pinned [`kagenti/pi`](https://github.com/kagenti/pi) coding agent through
  an injectable `SessionStorageBackend` seam; the agent itself is unmodified.
- **Promote a local Claude Code workflow** — `sh promote` bundles skills, `CLAUDE.md`, memory, and a
  slash command from your local `~/.claude` into a content-addressed bundle a leaf can dispatch by
  digest (see [Promoting a local Claude Code workflow](#promoting-a-local-claude-code-workflow)).

## Quick Start

Bring up the full stack on a local [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster and drive an agent that
scales to zero and resumes from cold — no local image build required.

> **Prerequisites:** `kind`, `kubectl`, `docker`, and an Anthropic-compatible model credential.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rossoctl/serverless-harness.git
cd serverless-harness

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...    # ...or a gateway: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL + ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN

./deploy/knative/setup-kind.sh     # installs Knative + Kourier, Redis, the sandbox, and KEDA
```

`setup-kind.sh` **pulls the published image** (`ghcr.io/rossoctl/serverless-harness:latest`) by
default, so a first run needs no local Docker build. The default model is `claude-haiku-4-5` (fast and
cheap — ideal for a live demo).

**Next — take the guided tour:**
[`docs/demos/serverless-harness-demo.md`](docs/demos/serverless-harness-demo.md) is a ~10-minute,
two-act walkthrough where you watch the agent **cold-start from zero, drop back to zero and resume
with full memory** (Act 1), then **fan out into a fleet of worker pods** that appear on demand and
vanish when the queue drains (Act 2). It's the fastest way to see what a serverless agent does that
an always-on one can't.

**Then — the remote sandbox:**
[`docs/demos/remote-sandbox-demo.md`](docs/demos/remote-sandbox-demo.md) drives a sandbox running as
a plain `docker run` **on your laptop** — outside the cluster, with **zero inbound rules** and no
cluster credential — executing a leaf's tool calls. Same request, opposite verdicts, and a secret you
plant by hand that the cluster reads back. Scripted equivalent: `make demo-remote-sandbox`.

All guided demos are indexed in [`docs/demos/`](docs/demos/).

For setup options and troubleshooting see
[`deploy/knative/README-kind.md`](deploy/knative/README-kind.md);
[`deploy/knative/SMOKE.md`](deploy/knative/SMOKE.md) documents the verified smoke-test claims.

---

## Deploy on OpenShift

For OpenShift (4.20+), use [`deploy/knative/setup-ocp.sh`](deploy/knative/setup-ocp.sh) — the
OpenShift-native sibling of `setup-kind.sh`. It installs OpenShift Serverless (Knative + Kourier)
via the Red Hat operator, deploys Redis, the sandbox, the PVC and the harness Knative Service, and
exposes it over an auto-created **OpenShift Route** (no port-forward).

```bash
oc login ...                       # cluster-admin on OpenShift 4.20+
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...    # or the gateway vars above
./deploy/knative/setup-ocp.sh      # add --dry-run to preview, --with-keda for async leaf
```

The full guide — prerequisites, flags, storage/SCC notes, smoke testing over the Route, and
troubleshooting — is in **[`deploy/knative/README-ocp.md`](deploy/knative/README-ocp.md)**.

---

## How It Works

1. **An orchestrator POSTs a leaf** to `/runs` (or `/turn` for a single interactive turn).
2. The **Knative Service** wakes from zero, and either runs the leaf inline (`sync`) or pushes the
   envelope onto **Redis Streams** and returns `202` (`async: true`), then idles back to zero.
3. For async work, a **KEDA ScaledJob** scales `leaf-worker` pods up on queue depth and drains items.
4. Both paths call **`runLeaf()`**, which executes all tools inside **`sandbox-0`** via `kubectl exec`.
5. **Session state streams to Redis** as it goes, so the leaf is resumable by `sessionId` even if its
   pod dies mid-run.
6. **Results land as files** on a shared PVC, and a **done-marker** signals completion to the
   orchestrator.

### Promoting a local Claude Code workflow

Iterate on a workflow locally in Claude Code — skills, `CLAUDE.md`, memory, a slash command —
then promote it:

```bash
cd harness && pnpm promote --entry my-workflow --project /path/to/your/project
```

`promote` reads the workflow — skills, `CLAUDE.md` chain, and memory — from `--project`, so
running it from the harness checkout without `--project` promotes the harness's own
configuration, not yours.

`promote` dedupes and classifies your local configuration, drops what cannot work in the harness
(with a reason for each), and scans for credentials before uploading. The scan has two tiers: a
structural match on a known key shape (an AWS access key, a PEM private-key block, a GitHub or
Slack token, an OpenAI-style key) **refuses the upload** and exits non-zero; a weaker prose
heuristic (`token: <value>`-shaped lines) only **warns and proceeds**, leaving the judgement to
you — that heuristic matches code and documentation placeholders too often to block on safely. It
writes a committable `.claude/promoted.lock.json` and uploads a content-addressed bundle; an
unchanged re-promotion uploads nothing.

Dispatch it by adding one field to any prompt leaf:

```json
{ "sessionId": "run-1/item-1", "kind": "prompt", "prompt": "…", "configRef": "sha256:…" }
```

Memory travels **read-only** — a promoted run consumes what you taught it locally and reports
discoveries back in the leaf result, which keeps leaf replay reproducible
([ADR-0031](docs/adrs/0031-promoted-memory-read-only.md)). MCP servers and subagents are not
promoted; see the [design](docs/specs/2026-09-02-claude-code-workflow-promotion-design.md) §2, §9.

## Dispatch Archetypes

The same backend serves three orchestration patterns, all validated end-to-end on Kind:

| Archetype             | Pattern                                                                 | Example use case                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **A — Async fan-out** | `{async:true}` → Redis Streams → KEDA scales workers 0→N → done-markers | "Research 10 topics concurrently"                    |
| **B — Human gate**    | Leaf pauses → `awaiting_approval` → external verdict → resume/terminate | "Draft a clause, pause for legal sign-off, finalize" |
| **C — Scheduled**     | CronJob → `cron-dispatch` reads a config list → posts each as async     | "Summarize yesterday's tickets at 02:00 daily"       |

## Evidence

Behaviour and economics are backed by reproducible experiments rather than claims:

- **[`deploy/knative/EXPERIMENTS.md`](deploy/knative/EXPERIMENTS.md)** — cluster experiments E1
  (economics), E3 (mobility), E4 (recovery), run live on Kind.
- **[`docs/experiment-results.md`](docs/experiment-results.md)** — E2 (reconstruction cost) and E5
  (budget enforcement) from the `@sh/experiments` workspace.
- **[`deploy/knative/SMOKE.md`](deploy/knative/SMOKE.md)** — the 6/6 cold-start + resume smoke claims.

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Decoupled Harness (built):** Redis session backend, remote sandbox client, persistent
in-pod channel, Knative wrapper, compaction-checkpoint fast path, experiments, and the leaf-session
backend with all three dispatch archetypes. See the
[milestone registry](docs/specs/README.md) for the source-of-truth status of every milestone.

**Phase 2 — Zero-Trust Credential Plane (design complete, deferred):** a credential plane where
_no component influenced by model output ever holds a raw secret._

| ID  | Adds                                                                  |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Z1  | Per-session SPIFFE identity (SPIRE)                                   |
| Z2  | Secret-free, default-deny harness lock-down                           |
| Z3  | Inference injector — provider-key chokepoint, mTLS to the LLM gateway |
| Z4  | MCP code-mode in the sandbox                                          |
| Z5  | Generalized credentialed egress (sandbox forward proxy)               |
| Z6  | Subagents as isolated child sessions                                  |
| Z7  | Red-team + formal validation of the credential plane                  |

Today the harness uses a trust-the-operator model: the model credential is a pre-provisioned
Kubernetes Secret, there is no egress policy, and all leaves share one service-account identity. Those
gaps are exactly what Phase 2 closes.
