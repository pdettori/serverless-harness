# future edit can re-inline a copy of validate_discriminator or assert_verdict into either
# script and every existing check still passes, while the two proofs quietly drift apart and
# one keeps asserting something the other dropped.
#
# Static: greps the scripts, runs no cluster and no kubectl. Complements the live gate

# The two callers now dispatch differently ON PURPOSE, and both pairs are locked here:
#   - demo-remote-worker.sh uses dispatch_prompt + assert_reply_contains/_lacks, whose reply
#     NAMES the OS the model read -- that is what the demo has to show a room.
#   - relay-leaf-smoke.sh keeps dispatch_pattern + assert_verdict, whose binary CLEAR/FLAGGED
#     is the stronger gate for a live smoke that cannot run in CI.
# What must NOT diverge is the placement machinery both proofs rest on
# (validate_discriminator, assert_no_pods_match, count_pool_pods) -- and neither pair may be
# re-inlined into a caller, or the two proofs can drift apart exactly as before.
