# Laptop showcase: a sandbox OUTSIDE the cluster, with zero inbound rules, executing a
# leaf's tool calls.
#
#   laptop
#   |- kind cluster:  Knative + Redis + harness (ksvc) + sandbox-relay
#   \- docker run:    remote-worker  --dials out-->  relay
#
# The worker runs as a plain `docker run` on the host, NOT as a pod. That is the whole
# point: it is outside the cluster, it publishes no ports, and it reaches the relay by
# dialing *out* through a port-forward. A worker deployed as a pod (worker-example.yaml,
# and the relay-leaf-smoke.sh gate) demonstrates the plumbing but not the driver.
#
# What it proves, and why a single green run would not: the harness's select-sandbox.ts
# builds candidates = [...pods, ...grpcRecs] and leases least-loaded-first, so merely
# enabling SH_REMOTE_SANDBOX=1 does NOT route to the worker -- an idle in-cluster sandbox
# pod can still win, and the demo would "pass" having proven nothing. Two defenses:
#
#   1. Before the remote runs, assert the pool selector matches ZERO Running pods, so the
#      worker is the only candidate there is (structural, not merely detected).
#   2. Fingerprint the OS the exec actually ran on. The in-cluster pool is Alpine, the
#      worker image is RHEL, so a leaf grepping /etc/os-release for "Alpine" flips verdict
#      with the backend -- and the model names the OS it read in its own reason.
#
#        | backend            | pattern "Alpine" | model's stated reason        |
#        |--------------------|------------------|------------------------------|

#        | remote host worker | CLEAR            | "...Red Hat Enterprise Linux"|
#
# Usage:
#   ./demo-remote-worker.sh                  # no cluster -> passing A/B, one invocation
#   ./demo-remote-worker.sh --reuse-cluster   # skip setup if the cluster is already healthy
#   ./demo-remote-worker.sh --keep            # leave relay + worker running afterwards
#   ./demo-remote-worker.sh --teardown        # remove container, relay, image; ASK about the cluster
#   ./demo-remote-worker.sh --teardown --yes  # ...and delete the cluster without asking
#
# Requires: docker (or podman), kind, kubectl, jq -- and credentials for a model the
# cluster can reach (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN + ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL).
# No local Go toolchain: remote-worker/Dockerfile builds the binary in a builder stage.
