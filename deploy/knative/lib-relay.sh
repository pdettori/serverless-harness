# Shared assertions for the remote-sandbox (gRPC relay + worker) proofs.
#
# Sourced by BOTH the gated conformance smoke (relay-leaf-smoke.sh, worker as an
# in-cluster pod) and the laptop demo (demo-remote-worker.sh, worker as a host
# container). Everything here is worker-topology-agnostic on purpose: the two callers
# differ only in WHERE the worker runs and HOW its /etc/os-release is read, so the
# assertions that decide whether the proof holds must not be duplicated between them.
# A drifting copy would let one path keep asserting something the other no longer does.

# Source AFTER lib.sh -- this file builds on NS/KSVC/BASE/CURL_OPTS/CURL_HDR and ok/ko.
