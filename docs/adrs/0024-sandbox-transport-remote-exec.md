# ADR-0024: Remote sandbox exec over a worker-dialed gRPC stream, contract as language-neutral Protobuf

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-08
- **Deciders:** Serverless Harness team
- **Spec:** [`../specs/2026-07-08-sandbox-transport-grpc-design.md`](../specs/2026-07-08-sandbox-transport-grpc-design.md)

## Context

The harness runs every Pi tool call inside a sandbox pod via `kubectl exec`, so it must dial _into_ the pod through the kube API. That rules out any sandbox behind NAT, on-prem, on a laptop, or in another cloud — and blocks the top driver, bring-your-own (untrusted third-party) sandboxes. Reaching those requires inverting connectivity (the sandbox dials _out_) with a contract that is language-neutral (any runtime can host a worker) and firewall-friendly (one outbound TLS connection on `:443`), without touching the Pi loop, the session backend, or the leaf queue. An earlier revision of this PR got the outbound-dial direction right but carried the RPC over Redis Streams behind a TypeScript interface — locking workers to TS via JSON+base64 frames and forcing Redis (a port `:443`-only egress commonly blocks) into the exec path.

## Decision

We will delegate remote command execution over a single **worker-dialed gRPC bidirectional `Attach` stream (HTTP/2 on `:443`)**, define the contract as a **Protobuf IDL (`sandbox/v1`)** rather than a language-specific interface, and land both paths behind the existing **`SandboxTransport`** seam — `KubectlTransport` (today's in-cluster fast path, renamed) and a new `GrpcRelayTransport` are two implementations of one interface. A **single-replica, presence-only** in-cluster relay bridges the worker's outbound stream to the harness's in-cluster `SandboxExec` calls and mirrors connected workers into the existing Redis sandbox pool; matching stays in `select-sandbox`. One **Go reference worker** ships as the honest proof the contract is genuinely language-neutral.

### Alternatives considered

- **Redis-Streams transport + TS `@sh/sandbox-worker`** (this PR's prior revision) — rejected: TS lock-in through JSON+base64 frames, and Redis-on-its-port is blocked by `:443`-only egress while forcing a Redis dependency into exec.
- **Connect / HTTP-1.1 fallback** — rejected: full-duplex bidi needs HTTP/2 regardless, so Connect adds a second toolchain for no gain on the streaming core.
- **Relay owning matching / multi-replica HA** — deferred: a single replica needs no presence glue beyond the pool mirror, and matching stays in the existing pool.

## Consequences

- Positive: a sandbox can live anywhere behind one outbound `:443` connection with no inbound rules; any gRPC-capable language can host a worker; the in-cluster `kubectl-exec` path is unchanged; everything above `select-sandbox` stays transport-blind; the frame semantics (`req_id` correlation, at-least-once + dedup, dual-ended timeout, per-exec output cap) carry over verbatim.
- Negative / accepted cost: a new in-cluster relay component plus a Protobuf/gRPC toolchain; single-replica relay means a restart drops all parked streams and fails in-flight execs (recovery is leaf retry — no mid-exec durability); exactly-once is impossible — at-least-once + dedup only, with partial-write risk on crash.
- Follow-up owed: untrusted-BYO SPIFFE/mTLS on the same `Attach` endpoint; multi-replica relay HA; private-mesh reachability (Headscale / WireGuard); additional-language workers; HTTP/1.1-only proxy traversal — all additive behind the same seam.

## Revisions

### 2026-08-28 — `req_id` uniqueness (issue #179)

The original decision left `req_id` as "monotonic", which was implemented as a
module-scope counter — per process. `select-sandbox` shares a sandbox across replicas by
design (`max-scale: 5`, lease cap 20), and the relay keys per-exec sinks by `req_id`
within a session, so two replicas emitting `1, 2, 3…` could silently detach one caller
(it hangs to its deadline) and interleave both execs' output into the other.

**Decided:** ids carry a 21-bit per-process random salt in the high bits and a 32-bit
counter in the low bits. The maximum reachable id is `(2^21 − 1)·2^32 + (2^32 − 1) =
9007199254740991`, exactly `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` — required because the generated
TypeScript maps `uint64` through `longToNumber`. That is zero headroom, not a margin: the
layout lands precisely on the boundary, so widening the salt to 22 bits or the counter to
33 does not consume slack — it immediately crosses into precision loss and silent id
aliasing, where two different execs collapse onto one number. Uniqueness is probabilistic
in the salt (birthday collision ≈ 4.8e-6 across five replicas — `C(5,2)/2^21`) and exact in
the counter.

**Rejected:** widening the generated mapping to `string`/`Long` with a UUID — correct but
it reopens the `sandbox/v1` contract and the Go worker's cache key for a failure mode the
salt already closes. Also rejected: caller-scoped correlation at the relay
(`(callerId, reqId)`), which needs a proto field and leaves the worker's dedup cache still
keyed on a non-unique id.

**Consequence:** the relay now rejects a duplicate in-flight `req_id` rather than
overwriting the live sink, converting a silent misroute into a loud error.

### 2026-08-28 — the output cap moves onto the seam, but covers two of three transports

§8 always worded the cap as a harness-level property, but only `GrpcRelayTransport`
implemented it; `KubectlTransport` buffered without bound behind a `TODO(M3)`.

**Decided:** both **per-call** transports enforce it, the constant and marker live on the
seam (`transport.ts`), and the shared conformance battery asserts it for both — because a
cap on one implementation makes the transports distinguishable to Pi, which contradicts the
swappability the epic's driver #2 claims.

**Superseded by the 2026-08-30 revision below.** **Still not a seam-wide guarantee.** There
is a third `SandboxTransport`,
`persistentExecInPod`, and it remains uncapped; `extension.ts` gives it
Read/Write/Edit/Ls/Find, so the file-reading tools are exactly the ones running without a
cap. The battery therefore covers two of three implementations, and Pi can still tell the
backends apart on output volume. Capping the Read path is a production behaviour change and is tracked
separately. What _is_ closed here is the damaging consequence: because that transport falls
back to the capped `KubectlTransport` on channel death, a truncated read could reach Pi's
Edit tool and be written back over the file, so `createPodReadOps.readFile` now throws
instead of returning bytes it cannot vouch for.

### 2026-08-30 — the cap becomes seam-wide; truncation becomes explicit (issues #180, #181, #185)

The 2026-08-28 revision left the cap covering two of three transports and left truncation
represented only as a null exit code — a value that also means "signalled, no status".

**Decided:** `ExecResult` carries a required `truncated: boolean`, with the invariant
`truncated === true ⇒ exitCode === null`. Required rather than optional, so a fourth
transport cannot omit it and read as "not truncated" — that silent divergence is the defect.
`exitCode` stays null on truncation, so every caller that checks `!== 0` keeps failing
closed and there is no flag day.

**Decided:** `persistentExecInPod` is capped **in the pod**, by a `head -c <cap + 1>` stage
in `wrapCommand`'s pipeline. This caps raw bytes before base64 inflation, so the trip point
matches the per-call transports exactly; a client-side byte count would have capped content
at cap × 3/4, a weaker form of the same distinguishability. It also bounds
`FrameParser.push`, which re-stringifies its buffer per chunk and so grows quadratically.
`PIPESTATUS[0]` still indexes the command, and the resulting SIGPIPE 141 is ignored because
truncation is detected by length.

**Consequence, and the cost accepted:** a file above the cap is now **unreadable** through
Read/Edit — not merely truncated. `pi-fork`'s `read.ts` reads the whole file before applying
`offset`/`limit`, so the paging its own tool description advertises cannot reach past the
cap either. Accepted because Pi clips Read output to 2000 lines / 50 KB regardless, so what
is lost is a path returning bytes the model never saw, at the cost of harness memory and
quadratic parse time. `readFile` throws naming the cap, the path, and a `bash`+`sed`
range read, plus the file size when a truncation-path `stat` can supply it.

**Decided:** `createPodBashOps` returns **137** on truncation. 128+9 is the conventional
SIGKILL status and is accurate — the command was killed by signal 9 at the cap — and it
routes through Pi's own failure path, which appends the streamed output tail, so the model
gets both facts. **Rejected:** a bare throw, which loses the tail (`bash.ts` appends output
only for `aborted`/`timeout:` messages); patching `pi-fork` to carry both, which spans two
repos for a wording gain; and making truncation reject at the transport level, which
contradicts §8's truncate-and-surface contract and would change `GrpcRelayTransport`'s
behaviour, unchanged since ST3.

**Decided:** the battery's `producerStopped(): boolean` becomes
`producerStop(): ProducerStop`, a four-value mechanism each transport declares and the
battery pins. **Rejected:** a "was it remote?" boolean — it would assert `false` for both
kubectl paths and so discard the coverage that `child.kill` is actually called, which is
load-bearing (with it removed, deleting `child.kill` still passed). **Rejected:** making the
kubectl paths genuinely stop the remote producer by recording a pid and issuing a second
`kubectl exec`, which adds a wrapper and an extra exec to every call, with new pid-file
races, to defend a case only an already-hostile sandbox reaches — #57's territory.

**Consequence:** all three implementations run one battery. `persistentExecInPod` declares
`streams: false`, since it is request/response over one multiplexed channel; declared rather
than silently skipped, because quietly omitting a case for one implementation is how the
#185 asymmetry survived. Its pod-side pipeline is proved against a real `bash`
(`framing.test.ts`), not by the hermetic fake that simulates it.
