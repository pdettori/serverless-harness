# Agentic Pipeline Archetypes & Consolidated Requirements

Version: 1.0 — June 26, 2026
Status: Reference (the evidence base behind the Capability Charter)
Scope: Describes three independent, real agentic pipelines as **name-free archetypes** and
consolidates **all** their requirements into one catalog, so the harness roadmap is grounded in
observed demand rather than assumption. No project, product, or skill names appear here by design.
Anchors: [Capability Charter](2026-06-26-leaf-session-backend-capability-charter.md) (the conclusions); [MVP Thin Slice](2026-06-26-mvp-leaf-session-contract-design.md) (the first build).

> **Method.** Three independent production-ish agentic pipelines were examined directly (source,
> entrypoints, prompts, runtime packaging) and abstracted into archetypes A/B/C. The requirements in
> §7 are the **union** of what all three actually need — not a wish list.

| Purpose           | scan a corpus → produce candidate findings → review → validate each           | form a hypothesis → design+run a controlled experiment → extract principles → iterate       | fetch items from external sources on a schedule → dedup → filter for relevance → refine |
| Orchestrator      | deterministic staged scripts (`prepare→run→finalize`) with audit gates        | deterministic state machine with atomic checkpoint/resume                                   | a scheduler (cron) + event triggers + deterministic stages                              |
| Agent topology    | flat pool of **parallel worker** leaf-sessions (one per batch/finding)        | **two sequential roles** (planner, executor); ~2 LLM calls per iteration                    | deterministic stages + **single-call LLM leaf** filters                                 |
| Parallelism       | high (tens–hundreds of workers), bounded by a concurrency cap + per-class cap | low; isolation via per-condition **workspaces** (not agents)                                | low; per-source                                                                         |
| Model tiering     | per-phase: cheap pre-filter, stronger validation                              | per-role: stronger planner, cheaper executor                                                | light (a small/fast model for filtering)                                                |
| Human gates       | minimal (blocker intervention only)                                           | **explicit** approve / reject / abort + auto-mode                                           | **issue/comment**-driven include / skip / clarify                                       |

## 2. Archetype A — Parallel fan-out analysis

**Shape.** A deterministic controller runs stages as `prepare → run → finalize` triplets, each gated
by a machine-checkable `completion_audit` (`passed: true/false`) the next stage verifies. Stage 1
indexes a corpus and matches it against a catalog of rule/skill plugins to emit **candidates**; stage
2 reviews each candidate with an LLM (verdict ∈ {flagged, not-flagged, unknown}); an optional cheap
pre-filter stage discards obvious non-issues before expensive work; a final stage **validates** each
confirmed finding (is it real, is the path reachable, can a proof be built, what severity).

**Worker model.** A worker is a **parameterized agent-CLI invocation** (`<agent> --model {m} {prompt}`)
dispatched by an **OS subprocess pool** with a global concurrency cap and a per-rule/class cap (to
avoid API throttling), per-worker timeout, exponential-backoff retry, a circuit breaker, per-worker
logs, and idempotent progress files. **Workers do not spawn child agents** — and the design comments
make this an explicit choice: the subprocess pool _replaces_ "ask the main agent to spawn N
sub-agents in its own context."

**Distinctive requirements:** batching by rule/class; per-class concurrency caps; coverage audit
(every candidate has a verdict, verdict sums reconcile); verdict normalization (map loose model text
→ canonical labels); a tooled sandbox (symbol indexer, fast search, per-language build toolchains for
the validation stage); aggregated HTML/markdown reporting.

---

## 3. Archetype B — Iterative role-based reasoning loop

**Shape.** A deterministic state machine drives a fixed loop: `INIT → DESIGN → (human gate) →
EXECUTE/ANALYZE → (human gate) → DONE → DESIGN…`, merging extracted principles forward so each
iteration constrains the next. Exactly **two LLM roles** per iteration — a **planner** (stronger
model: explore, frame, design a hypothesis bundle) and an **executor** (cheaper model: build, patch,
run, analyze) — invoked turn-by-turn by the non-LLM orchestrator.

**Parallelism & subagents.** Experiment "arms" run in **isolated per-condition workspaces** (git
worktrees), reset between conditions — **workspaces, not agents**. Currently a single executor agent
runs arms sequentially. **Planned-but-not-yet-merged:** a dispatcher that spawns one
worktree-isolated **subagent per arm**, and an **explore** layer that fans out a fresh-context
subagent per investigation scope. → This is the one archetype with **forward intent to use
clean-context subagents** (see §6).

**Distinctive requirements:** human-in-the-loop gates (approve / reject→loop / abort) with structured
summaries + an auto-approve mode gated by safety preconditions; **schema-governed** artifact I/O with
a validator the agent can self-correct against; atomic **checkpoint/resume**; **cross-iteration
memory** (accumulated principles persisted separately from per-run logs); **locked-spec guardrails**
(declared immutable parameters with hard-fail enforcement to prevent silent drift under unattended
runs); reproducible experiment substrate (observable metrics, controllable knobs, repeatable runs);
patch capture & apply; post-run knowledge extraction across campaigns.

---

## 4. Archetype C — Scheduled ingestion & filtering

**Shape.** A scheduler (cron) and events (e.g. issue edits/comments) trigger independent stages:
fetch from external sources → deduplicate (incremental **cursors**) → filter for relevance (a
**single LLM call per item**, cheap/fast model) → refine → record. State is JSON committed to a
**git data store**; integration between stages is the git store + the scheduler, not in-process
calls. Human curation happens through **issue/comment** gates (include / skip / clarify).

**Subagents.** None; every component is deterministic Python or a **single CLI LLM call**. No agent
spawns children.

**Distinctive requirements:** **trigger/start abstraction** (cron + event); **incremental state**
(cursors, dedup) to process only new items; **git-backed artifact store** (not a volume); single-call
LLM **leaf filters** (no agent loop needed); event-driven **human gates** via an external system
(issues/comments); multi-source egress (several external content/source APIs); per-stage isolation
(each stage is its own scheduled job/container).

---

## 5. Cross-archetype invariants

All three share:

1. **A deterministic, non-LLM outer orchestrator.** State machine / staged scripts / scheduler. The
   LLM is always a **leaf**, never the controller.
2. **Agents are parameterized leaf invocations** — `(model, inputs) → structured output`.
3. **Per-role / per-phase model tiering**, multi-provider, env-selected.
4. **Structured, schema-/audit-governed artifacts** on a durable store, with **coverage/ledger** and
   **checkpoint/resume or incremental cursors**.
5. **Human-in-the-loop gates** as a first-class control point (central in B and C; light in A).
6. **Code/tool sandbox** with **isolated workspaces**; the orchestrator owns its **artifact store**
   (volume _or_ git), not the harness.
7. **Event/schedule or invocation start**; egress to a model API plus a few external services.

---

## 6. Subagent posture (verified)

**None of the three spawns subagents in currently-running code.** But the picture is nuanced and
splits subagent demand into two distinct patterns:

- **Bulk parallel fan-out** (A's many candidates; B's arms). Here the evidence says deterministic
  orchestration over **leaf sessions** is the _better_ tool — A explicitly **rejected** agent-managed
  subagents for this ("…replaces ask the main agent to spawn N sub-agents in its own context").
- **Clean-context subtask delegation** (B's planned per-scope **explore** subagents, and per-arm
  worktree subagents). This is a _genuine_ subagent use — a leaf agent offloading a focused subtask to
  a fresh-context child. B intends it (built, not yet merged).

**Conclusion for the harness:** the clean-context-subagent need is satisfied **for free by a
re-entrant leaf-session contract** — a leaf session that wants a fresh-context subtask simply invokes
the same leaf-session contract to dispatch a **child** leaf session (clean context + own sandbox by
construction). No separate subagent runtime is required for the core need. What genuinely remains for
a later milestone (Z6) is only the **extras**: parent/child lineage, budget propagation, sandbox
policy, and inter-agent messaging. Bulk fan-out stays deterministic; recursion is opt-in via the same
contract.

## 8. What this means for the harness

- The **MVP** ([thin slice](2026-06-26-mvp-leaf-session-contract-design.md)) covers the ⭐-MVP rows: the
  leaf-session contract, run-to-completion, structured output, volume envelope, read-only workspace,
  per-call model, idempotent retry, per-leaf status — single-tenant, key-in-env.
- **Promote post-MVP** (next, demand-ordered): the **human-gate** primitive (B), the **trigger/cron**
  on-ramp (C), the **tooled image**, token/cost audit, and CoW/worktree workspaces.
- **Keep-light:** Z3 (model-key injection) and Z5 (source/content egress) — env-based until hardening.
- **Defer:** Z1 (per-user identity) until multi-tenant hosting; Z6 **extras** (the core
  clean-context-subagent need is a re-entrant contract, §6).
