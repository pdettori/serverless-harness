# Human-Gate — "Gate-While-Idle" (Archetype B) — Design

Version: 1.0 — June 28, 2026
Status: Design (approved for implementation planning)
Scope: The **human-in-the-loop gate** primitive for the leaf-session backend — the last unbuilt
archetype. A single logical leaf session **pauses mid-pipeline awaiting an external human decision,
parks in durable state with the pod scaled to zero, and resumes with the decision injected**,
preserving full context across one or more gates before reaching a verdict. This is the canonical
**async + scale-to-zero + durable-resume** case (archetypes [§7.6](2026-06-26-pipeline-archetypes-requirements.md),
charter [§8.3](2026-06-26-leaf-session-backend-capability-charter.md)).
Realizes: [Archetypes & Requirements §7.6](2026-06-26-pipeline-archetypes-requirements.md) (gate primitive; gate-while-idle) + [Capability Charter](2026-06-26-leaf-session-backend-capability-charter.md) G8 ("promote post-MVP: human-gate"). Single-tenant, key-in-env.
Builds on (reuse, no redesign): the leaf-session contract + `runLeaf` (MVP/PR #10), gate-7 durable
resume (PR #11), async leaf completion (`POST /runs {async:true}` + `leaf-queue` + KEDA
`ScaledJob`, [async design](2026-06-27-async-leaf-completion-design.md)), M2/M3 sandbox, M4 Knative
scale-to-zero, M5 checkpoint/resume, M6 model selection.
Defers (per charter): auto-approve mode (§1, non-precluding); harness-side timeout/TTL (§5);
multi-tenancy & per-user identity (Z1), credential plane (Z3/Z5), event-driven gates (Archetype C).

> **One-line finding.** The gate is not new machinery — it is **a structured-output terminal plus a

## 1. Goal & scope

### Proves (the capability, end to end)

> A leaf session calls a `request_approval` tool, **pauses** with a structured summary on the
> orchestrator's volume, and the service **scales to zero** while parked; an **external** approver
> writes a decision (approve / reject / abort) and **re-invokes the same `sessionId`**; the session
> **resumes from durable state with full prior context**, applies the decision, and runs to a
> verdict — surviving multiple gates and mid-park crashes, **idempotently**.

### In scope

- A **`request_approval` structured-input tool** (job-mode), parallel to `submit_verdict`.
- A durable **gate-request** custom entry + a monotonic **`gateId`** per session.
- An **`awaiting_approval` gate marker** on the volume (parallel to the done-marker).
- A **`decisionRef`** decision-file contract (approve / reject / abort + optional feedback).
- A **resume state machine** in `runLeaf`: pending-gate detection, `gateId`-keyed idempotency,
  decision application, continuation-prompt seeding (approve/reject), abort.
- **Async + sync integration**: a `paused` `LeafResult`/marker that **acks** the queue (parked work),
  extended `classifyOutcome`.
- Unit tests + a gated **live gate** smoke (`leaf-gate-smoke.sh`).

### Out of scope (YAGNI / deferred)

- **Auto-approve mode** ([§7.6](2026-06-26-pipeline-archetypes-requirements.md) "auto-mode gated by
  safety preconditions"). The tool and envelope are shaped so an `autoApprove` policy can be added
  later (a flag that makes `request_approval` return `approved` inline without parking), but building
  the safety-precondition surface now is unneeded for the first slice. **Non-precluding, not built.**
- **Harness-side timeout / TTL** on a parked gate — the orchestrator owns deadlines (§5, Q4).
- Multi-tenancy, per-user identity (Z1), credential plane (Z3/Z5), event-driven gates (C).
- Any change to the synchronous `POST /runs`, async enqueue, cron-dispatch, `leaf-queue`, the
  KEDA `ScaledJob`, or `submit_verdict` — all **unchanged**. A leaf that never calls
  `request_approval` behaves exactly as today.

## 2. The gate contract

### 2.1 `request_approval` tool (job-mode, alongside `submit_verdict`)

```
request_approval({
  summary:         string,   // what was done / decided so far (the human reads this)
  proposed_action: string    // what the agent intends to do next, pending sign-off
})
```

On call the harness:

1. Validates args (both non-empty strings); on mismatch → tool error back into the session (the
   agent can retry, exactly like `submit_verdict`).
2. Appends a durable **gate-request** custom entry: `{ gateId, summary, proposed_action }`, where
   `gateId` = the count of prior gate-request entries in this session (0, 1, 2, …).
3. Returns a **benign synchronous result**: _"Approval requested; the session will pause and resume
   with the human decision."_ — so the assistant turn ends **well-formed** (no dangling `tool_use`;
   this is what makes resume robust, B2).

The tool sets a capture flag (`gateRequested`, with the new `gateId`) that `runLeaf` inspects after
the loop (§3). The agent is expected to stop after calling it; if it continues, the turn still ends
normally and `runLeaf` parks at the loop boundary.

### 2.2 `awaiting_approval` gate marker

Written **atomically** (temp + rename) to a derived `gateRef` (default `<resultRef>.gate`, override
via `envelope.gateRef`), on the **orchestrator-owned** volume:

```json
{
  "status": "awaiting_approval",
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "gateId": 0,
  "gate": { "summary": "…", "proposed_action": "…" },
  "ts": "<iso8601>"
}
```

The `gateRef` lives in the orchestrator's directory (charter G3) — the harness is **not** on the
approval critical path. The marker advertises the **current** `gateId` the approver must answer.

### 2.3 Decision file (`decisionRef`)

The external approver writes this file (on the volume) and then re-invokes (§2.5):

```json
{ "gateId": 0, "action": "approve" | "reject" | "abort", "feedback": "<optional>" }
```

- `gateId` **must** echo the marker's `gateId`; a decision whose `gateId` does not match the pending
  gate is **ignored** (§3, §5 — prevents a stale decision answering a later gate).
- `feedback` is used by `reject` (and may accompany `approve`); ignored by `abort`.

### 2.4 Envelope additions (optional, backward-compatible)

`LeafEnvelope` gains two optional fields; defaults preserve today's behavior exactly:

- `gateRef?: string` — override the derived gate-marker path (default `<resultRef>.gate`).
- `decisionRef?: string` — present on a **resume** invocation; the harness reads the decision here.
  Absent on the first (gating) invocation.

No other field changes. `async`, `doneMarkerRef`, `tenant`, `model`, `maxTurns`, etc. are untouched.

### 2.5 Resume trigger

Resume is an **ordinary re-invocation** of `POST /runs` with the **same `sessionId`** plus
`decisionRef` (and `async` honored as usual):

```
POST /runs { sessionId: "<same>", inputsRef, resultRef, decisionRef, workspaceRef?, model?, async? }
  → sync:  200 { status: "done" | "paused" | "aborted" | "failed", … }
  → async: 202 { status: "accepted", sessionId, resultRef, doneMarker }
```

No new endpoint, no watcher. The orchestrator/human is the caller (G1/G2).

### 2.6 `LeafResult` + marker status additions

- `LeafResult` gains:
  - `{ status: "paused"; gateRef: string; gateId: number }`
  - `{ status: "aborted" }`
- Marker `status` enums extend: the **gate marker** adds `awaiting_approval`; the **terminal**
  done-marker adds `aborted` (alongside `done | failed`). The two are distinct files (§4).

**`runLeaf` writes the gate marker.** In **both** sync and async modes, whenever a leaf parks,
`runLeaf` itself writes the `awaiting_approval` gate marker to `gateRef` — because the summary it
carries comes from the session log, which only `runLeaf` has (the queue runner sees only the
`LeafResult`). **Sync path:** the call returns promptly `200 { status: "paused", gateRef, gateId,
sessionId }` (gate marker already on the volume); the caller is **not** blocked and the pod scales to
zero. **Async path:** the leaf-job's `runLeaf` writes the gate marker, then `classifyOutcome` **acks**
the entry (§4).

---

## 3. The resume state machine (inside `runLeaf`)

A front-end runs on **every** invocation (fresh or resume), before the agent loop:

```
1. open session
     prior   = store.read(sid)
     resuming = prior.length > 0
     sm = resuming ? openFromCheckpoint(sid) : create(sid)

2. verdict fast-path (UNCHANGED, M5)
     if a verdict custom entry exists → recover it → return { status: "done" }

3. pending-gate detection
     pendingGate = the latest gate-request entry whose gateId has NO matching gate-decision entry
                   (null if none)

4. branch — compute `seedPrompt` (the turn to drive) or short-circuit:
   (a) pendingGate AND decisionRef provided AND decision.gateId == pendingGate.gateId:
         if NO gate-decision entry exists yet for this gateId → append a durable gate-decision
           entry { gateId, action, feedback }   (idempotent: appended at most once per gateId)
         action == "abort"           → return { status: "aborted" }   (no agent run)
         action == "approve"|"reject"→ seedPrompt = continuationPrompt(action, feedback)

   (b) pendingGate AND (no decisionRef OR decision.gateId != pendingGate.gateId):
         duplicate / early / stale resume → set capture.gate from pendingGate →
         return { status: "paused", gateRef, gateId }   (NO agent run — idempotent no-op)

   (c) no pendingGate:
         lastDecision = the most recent gate-decision entry (null if none)
         seedPrompt = lastDecision ? continuationPrompt(lastDecision.action, lastDecision.feedback)
                                   : buildLeafPrompt(item)          // fresh start (UNCHANGED)

5. run the agent loop:  session.prompt(seedPrompt)   // re-seeds each invocation, exactly like the
                                                      // existing verdict-resume re-prompts buildLeafPrompt

6. after the loop (inspect capture flags)
     submit_verdict called    → write `done` marker, return { status: "done", resultRef }
     request_approval called  → write `awaiting_approval` gate marker (the new gateId), return
                                { status: "paused", gateRef, gateId }
     neither                  → return { status: "failed", reason: "no_verdict" }
```

**`gateId` is the idempotency spine.** A session may pass several gates; the marker advertises the
_current_ `gateId` and the decision file must echo it. A resume applies a decision **only** when its
`gateId` matches the pending gate, so:

- a **stale/replayed** decision (answering an already-consumed gate) is **ignored** (branch (b));
- a **double-resume** with the same decision **re-seeds the same continuation** (branch (a) →
  re-derive → (c)/run), which is idempotent: the gate-decision entry is appended **at most once** per
  `gateId`, and re-running the post-decision turn overwrites to the same verdict — exactly the
  idempotency the existing initial-prompt resume already relies on.

This is the gate analogue of the verdict fast-path: **durable custom entries make replay safe.**

### 3.1 Continuation seeding (B2 in practice)

The harness drives every turn — fresh or resumed — by calling `session.prompt(seedPrompt)`, the same
mechanism job-mode uses to seed its initial prompt (`openFromCheckpoint` loads the prior context but
does not by itself run a turn). On a gate resume the `seedPrompt` is the **continuation prompt**
derived from the decision (`"Human decision: APPROVED. <feedback?> Proceed."` /
`"Human decision: REJECTED: <feedback>. Revise; you may request approval again."`). Because the prior
turns (including the `request_approval` exchange) are already in the durable log and replayed into
context, the agent continues coherently. No `tool_use`/`tool_result` surgery; the transcript stays
well-formed across the park.

**Crash-mid-resume safety.** The gate-decision entry is appended (once) before the agent loop and
flushed through `BufferedRedisBackend`. If the pod crashes after the decision is recorded but before
a verdict, the reclaim/re-invoke finds the gate already decided (no pending gate), takes branch (c),
**re-derives the same continuation prompt** from the durable gate-decision entry, and re-runs — the
decision is never recorded twice and the re-run is idempotent (overwrites to the same verdict). The
gate-decision entry is the idempotency guard that prevents a _second_ decision from being recorded
for a consumed `gateId`.

---

## 4. Async integration (`classifyOutcome` + KEDA)

**Two marker kinds, two writers.** The async substrate already has a _terminal_ done-marker at
`<resultRef>.status` written by the **queue runner** (via `classifyOutcome.marker`), absent in sync
mode (the HTTP response conveys the terminal status). The gate adds a distinct _non-terminal_ **gate
marker** at `gateRef` (`<resultRef>.gate`) that carries the session-derived summary — so **`runLeaf`
writes it directly, in both sync and async modes** (the queue runner only has the `LeafResult`, not
the summary). `classifyOutcome` therefore returns **no terminal marker** for `paused` (runLeaf
already wrote the gate marker); it only decides the ack:

| `runLeaf` outcome                                     | gate marker (`gateRef`, by `runLeaf`)          | terminal marker (`<resultRef>.status`, by runner/async) | queue action                         | rationale                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `done`                                                | —                                              | `done`                                                  | **XACK**                             | success (unchanged)                                    |
| **`paused`**                                          | **`awaiting_approval`** (written by `runLeaf`) | — (none; not terminal)                                  | **XACK**                             | parked; resume is a _new_ invocation, not a redelivery |
| **`aborted`**                                         | —                                              | **`aborted`**                                           | **XACK**                             | terminal by human decision                             |
| `failed: bad_inputs \| no_verdict \| invalid_verdict` | —                                              | `failed`                                                | **XACK**                             | deterministic (unchanged)                              |
| `failed: error`                                       | —                                              | none                                                    | **no ack → reclaim**                 | transient (unchanged)                                  |
| process **crash**                                     | —                                              | none                                                    | **no ack → reclaim → gate-7 resume** | unchanged                                              |

So `classifyOutcome`'s new branches are: `paused` → `{ ack: true, marker: null }`; `aborted` →
`{ ack: true, marker: { status: "aborted" } }`. The resume invocation is an ordinary sync POST or
async enqueue with the same `sessionId` + `decisionRef`. On the async path it `XADD`s a fresh entry
→ KEDA spawns a leaf-job → `runLeaf` resumes from the log, applies the decision, continues.
**Nothing** in the `WorkQueue`, `ScaledJob`, heartbeat, or dead-letter machinery changes.

> **Status endpoint visibility.** `GET /runs/status` is extended so that, when no terminal
> marker is present, it also checks the sibling gate marker and reports `awaiting_approval` (with
> `gateId`) instead of defaulting to `queued`. The **primary** completion signal stays the
> orchestrator polling the gate / terminal markers on its own volume (G3); the endpoint is the
> secondary convenience path (async §3.4).

> **Marker overwrite across gates.** A second gate in the same session overwrites the
> `awaiting_approval` gate marker with the new `gateId`. The orchestrator detects a _new_ gate by the
> changed `gateId` (and, if it wants history, can snapshot markers — its concern, G3).

## 5. Failure modes, idempotency, timeout

- **Crash while parked, before the gate marker is written:** the gate-request entry is already
  durable, so on reclaim/re-invoke `runLeaf` detects the pending gate and (no `decisionRef` yet)
  takes branch (b) — **writes the missing `awaiting_approval` marker without re-running the agent**
  and returns `paused`. The `gateId` is unchanged (derived from the durable entry). (Sync caller sees
  a connection drop → re-invokes → same result. Async: entry unacked → reclaimed.)
- **Crash mid-resume (decision recorded, no verdict yet):** the gate-decision entry is durable →
  reclaim/re-invoke finds no pending gate (branch (c)), **re-derives the same continuation prompt**
  from that entry, and re-runs idempotently to verdict. The decision is never recorded twice.
- **Double / conflicting decision (approve-then-reject):** the **first** matching-`gateId` decision
  is recorded durably and wins; later decisions for a consumed `gateId` are ignored. If two decision
  files race **before** any resume reads one, last-writer-on-the-file wins — documented; the
  orchestrator owns not racing itself (it is the single approving authority, G1/G2).
- **Stale decision applied to a new gate:** prevented by `gateId` matching (§3).
- **`decisionRef` missing/garbled on resume:** treated as "no decision" → branch (b) → stays
  `paused` (no agent run). Safe no-op; the approver re-writes and re-invokes.
- **Timeout:** **none in the harness** (B4). A parked session waits indefinitely; the orchestrator
  enforces deadlines by re-invoking with `abort`. _(Non-precluding future: an envelope `gateTTL` +
  a KEDA-cron sweeper that writes `aborted` markers — not built; see §7.)_
- **Re-entrancy preserved:** the gate adds no caller-identity assumption, so a child leaf could
  itself gate. Non-precluding, untested (consistent with MVP §2.5).

**Effectively-once outcome:** at-least-once delivery × idempotent `runLeaf` (durable gate-request /
gate-decision / verdict entries + overwrite) = the same terminal state regardless of redelivery or
double-resume.

Redis-backed assertions are **gated** like existing `redis-backend` tests (skip when no `REDIS_URL`).

### 7.2 Live gate — `deploy/knative/leaf-gate-smoke.sh` (gated `GATE_LIVE_SMOKE=1`)

On the Kind `sh-knative` cluster (async path already deployed: KEDA + `ScaledJob`, Redis, sandbox-0,
`/work` PVC, ksvc). A fixture prompt deterministically requests approval once before its verdict.
**The controller runs this live gate directly — never a subagent.**

1. **Pause:** dispatch a gated leaf → `awaiting_approval` marker appears on `/work` with `gateId:0`
   - summary; **no** `result_ref`; session parked.
2. **Scale-to-zero while parked:** with the gate pending and no other work, leaf-job pods reach
   **zero** (KEDA acked the parked entry).
3. **Resume-approve:** write `decisionRef {gateId:0, approve}` → re-invoke same `sessionId` → leaf
   resumes, runs to **verdict** → `done` marker + correct verdict.
4. **Resume-reject-then-approve:** reject with feedback → agent revises, gates again (`gateId:1`) →
   approve → completes with verdict.
5. **Abort:** write `{abort}` → `aborted` marker, **no** verdict, entry acked.
6. **Idempotent resume:** re-invoke with an already-consumed decision (and a stale `gateId`) → **no**
   duplicate continuation; terminal state stable.

`setup-kind.sh` needs **nothing new** (no new cluster prereq — gate reuses the async path). Verbose
`kubectl`/build output redirects to `/tmp/kagenti/human-gate/` logs, analyzed in subagents
(CLAUDE.md context budget).

## 8. Scope / YAGNI — explicitly NOT building

- **Auto-approve mode** (the safety-precondition surface) — shaped-for, not built (§1).
- **Harness-side timeout / TTL** + any sweeper — orchestrator owns deadlines (§5).
- **Tool-result injection** resume style (B2 chose continuation-prompt).
- **Harness-side decision watcher / auto-resume** — resume is an external re-invocation (B3).
- Multi-tenancy, per-user identity (Z1), credential plane (Z3/Z5), event-driven gates (C).
- Any change to sync `POST /runs`, async enqueue, cron-dispatch, `leaf-queue`, the KEDA
  `ScaledJob`, `submit_verdict`, or the heartbeat/dead-letter machinery — all **unchanged**.
- A new container image — the gate reuses the harness image and existing entrypoints.

**Substrate-agnostic seam:** the gate _contract_ (gate tool → `awaiting_approval` marker → external
`decisionRef` → re-invoke-by-`sessionId` → continuation) depends only on `runLeaf`'s durable session
log + the marker convention, **not** on KEDA or Knative. A KEDA-less or always-on deployment drives
the identical contract.

---

## 9. Cluster prerequisites

- Everything the async path already needs (KEDA, `leaf-queue`/group, the `leaf-work` `/work` PVC,
  `sandbox-0`, `llm-credentials`, the Knative service). **No new prerequisite.**
- The new `deploy/knative/leaf-gate-smoke.sh` is a test script, not a deployed component.
