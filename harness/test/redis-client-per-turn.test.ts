/**
 * Structural guard: nothing on the per-turn path may construct a Redis client.
 *
 * Every Redis client class in this repo connects EAGERLY in its constructor, so "one per turn" is
 * one live connection per turn. That was latent for years because a turn was served by a Knative
 * container that went away afterwards. The P6 supervisor made it fatal: a worker is process-lived
 * and admits S concurrent turns for hours, so the connections accumulate.
 *
 * Measured on real hardware at 27-54 turns/s:
 *
 *   before: ~3.5 connections per turn, monotonically leaked (RedisSessionBackend per turn in
 *           executeTurnCore, RedisLeaseStore per call in selectPoolSandbox and never closed,
 *           RedisRecordStore per call and closed) -> 35,654 connections over ~10k turns ->
 *           `ERR max number of clients reached` against maxclients 10000 -> node-redis raised an
 *           'error' on clients with no listener -> ALL FOUR WORKERS exited code 1 simultaneously,
 *           mid-rung, ~13 minutes in, stranding every in-flight turn.
 *   after:  0.017 connections per turn across a second warm batch, connected_clients delta 0.
 *
 * No unit test could see this: each construction is individually correct, the leak is only visible
 * as an aggregate over thousands of turns, and a suite that mocks Redis never opens a socket. Hence
 * a source-level assertion — cheap, and it fails the moment someone reintroduces the pattern.
