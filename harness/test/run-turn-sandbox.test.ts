// executeTurn resolved its sandbox from process.env unconditionally (ADR 0028: prompt leaves
// "inherit /turn's sandbox routing"), which left a leased pool sandbox — and the whole remote
// relay transport — unreachable from a prompt leaf. That was fixed for leaves by injection.
//
// It was NOT fixed for /turn, which is what acquireTurnSandbox now closes: /turn used to call
// resolveSandboxConfig alone, so a deployment configuring a POOL had its turn's tool calls run in
// the harness process. Proven on hardware — the tool's file landed in the supervisor unit's own
// PrivateTmp namespace, never in a sandbox container.
//
// The load-bearing property in here is the no-pool EQUIVALENCE: /turn is live for every Knative
// deployment, so a deployment with no KAGENTI_SANDBOX_POOL_SELECTOR must resolve exactly as it did
// before, and must arm no lease renewal.
