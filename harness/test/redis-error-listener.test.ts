/**
 * Every long-lived client in the harness must register `'error'`, or losing a socket ends the worker.
 *
 * node-redis re-emits socket errors on the client (`RedisSocket.#onSocketError`), and an EventEmitter
 * `'error'` with no listener is an uncaught exception. The initial-connect path is NOT the dangerous
 * one — it emits from inside the awaited `connect()` chain, so the throw becomes that promise's
 * rejection — which is why the omission survived review for so long. The dangerous one is a drop on
 * an ESTABLISHED connection, verified with `CLIENT KILL` against the probe's own connection on the
 * pinned redis@6.2.1: no listener exits on `SocketClosedUnexpectedlyError`, one listener recovers.
 *
 * These three stores are all memoised for the process's life (`select-sandbox.ts` for two of them),
 * so no turn need be in flight for a Redis restart to reach them.
 *
 * `RedisRecordStore` is included even though #251 gave it its own inline copy of the pairing: this is
 * the cross-cutting pin that a NEW long-lived store cannot be added without one, and it is cheap.
 * The bound that must accompany the listener is pinned separately, in
 * `packages/session-backend/test/redis-resilient-client.test.ts`.
