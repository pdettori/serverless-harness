/**
 * A skill referencing one of its OWN files that the bundle omits would fail remotely as a
 * confusing read miss. Two deliberate restrictions, both measured against a real `~/.claude`:
 *
 * 1. **Only references the skill plausibly owns are flagged** — the reference must contain a `/`
 *    AND its directory prefix must be a directory the skill actually ships files in. Without this
 *    the check fired 182 times across 28 skills, because a skill's prose names plenty of paths it
 *    does not ship: `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json` (files the reader will create),
 *    `window.open` and `sys.path` (code), bare `.md`/`.py` (from "a `.md` file"), and example
 *    project trees. `main.py` and `references/guide.md` are indistinguishable in shape, so no
 *    regex separates them — only "does the skill own this directory" does. The rule cuts 182 to 9.
 *
 *    Ownership must be checked symmetrically against EVERY ancestor on both sides, not just each
 *    path's immediate parent — two failure directions, both measured:
 *      - ships `references/deep/x.md`, references missing `references/missing.md`: the skill's
 *        immediate parent is `references/deep/`, but it still owns `references/` (an ancestor of
 *        what it ships).
 *      - ships `references/guide.md`, references missing `references/deep/missing.md`: the
 *        reference's immediate directory `references/deep/` was never shipped, but its ancestor
 *        `references/` demonstrably is owned.
 *    Both sides are expanded into their full ancestor-prefix set and checked for exact-string
 *    intersection — never `startsWith` — so `references-old/` still does not satisfy a reference
 *    under `references/`; `references-old` and `references` are different path segments and never
 *    appear as the same string in either set.
 * 2. **Warn, not error.** The 9 survivors are still false positives (one skill documenting
 *    hypothetical `references/*.md` because its subject is how to write skills), so blocking would
 *    refuse promotion for anyone who has it installed. Preflight blocks only on facts.
 *
 * Satisfaction stays deliberately loose: a reference counts if any bundled path equals it, ends
 * with `/<ref>`, or the reference ends with the path — skills write paths relative to their own
 * directory or to the plugin root, and both are legitimate.
