/**
 * Reported in place of the command's exit code when a stage of the wrapper pipeline
 * itself failed (`head -c` or `base64`), rather than the command.
 *
 * This exists because the failure is otherwise INVISIBLE and destructive. If `head` is
 * absent, or present but rejects `-c`, the wrapper yields **empty stdout with the
 * command's own exit code of 0** — verified against real bash for both cases. A read
 * would then return an empty buffer with a success status, and Pi's Edit tool writes back
 * whatever the read returned, truncating the file to zero length. Negative because the
 * frame carries a single integer and no real exit status is negative; FrameParser already
 * accepts `-?\d+`.

/**
 * Build the line(s) written to the session's stdin for one command.
 *
 * `command` is run verbatim; its stdout is capped, base64-encoded, and bracketed by
 * `\x01B<nonce>` and `\x01E<nonce> <exit>` markers. The reported exit code is the
 * COMMAND's (`${PIPESTATUS[0]}`) — NOT base64's `$?`, which is ~always 0.
 *
 * `capBytes` bounds RAW stdout in the pod via `head -c <capBytes + 1>`, which is why the
 * cap is applied here rather than client-side (spec ST6 §3.3):
 *
 *  - It caps raw bytes BEFORE base64 inflation, so the trip point matches the per-call
 *    transports exactly. A client-side byte count would cap content at capBytes × 3/4.
 *  - `PIPESTATUS[0]` still indexes the command: adding a pipeline stage after the group
 *    does not shift index 0. A cap trip makes it 141 (SIGPIPE), which we ignore — the
 *    caller detects truncation by length, so nothing depends on telling that 141 apart
 *    from a command's own internal SIGPIPE.
 *  - It bounds `FrameParser.push`'s buffer, which is re-stringified per chunk and so
 *    grows quadratically in the frame size.
 *
 * `capBytes + 1` is requested deliberately: the caller flags truncation as
 * `stdout.length > capBytes`, so it needs one byte of evidence to distinguish output
 * that landed exactly on the cap (complete) from output that exceeded it.
 *
 * When `stdin` is provided it is delivered to the command via a nonce-delimited heredoc
 * (a shared-stdin session can't pipe separate per-command stdin). The heredoc body is
 * emitted as latin1 so arbitrary bytes survive round-trip; callers typically pass base64
 * payloads which are ASCII either way. The command must be a single pipeline whose first
 * stage consumes stdin (holds for `base64 -d > <path>`). The heredoc delimiter uses
 * `KAGENTI_EOF_<nonce>` — a bash-safe word that contains `_`, which the standard base64
 * alphabet (A-Za-z0-9+/=) never emits, so it cannot collide with a body line.
