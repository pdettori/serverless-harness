/**
 * Envelope encryption ON TOP of the Kubernetes Secret (spec §6.5). A Secret is base64, not
 * encryption, and namespace `get secrets` reads it -- so a namespace-wide secret read must yield
 * ciphertext. The KEK lives in a SEPARATE Secret mounted only into the control plane, making "read
 * the credential store" and "read the key that opens it" two distinct RBAC subjects.
 *
 * AES-256-GCM, and the AAD is `subject|name`. The AAD is free and buys a real property: an attacker
 * who can WRITE Secrets still cannot relabel Alice's ciphertext into Bob's row and spend her key,
 * because decryption then fails. Unambiguous because a credential name is restricted to
 * [a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]* (credential-store.ts), so no `|` can appear in either half.
 *
 * Wire form: `v1.<b64url iv>.<b64url tag>.<b64url ciphertext>`. Versioned so that moving to Vault
 * or External Secrets behind CredentialStore (spec §6.6) is distinguishable at rest rather than a
 * guess about which bytes are which.
 *
 * THE KEK IS A RING, for the same reason `parseKeyset` takes a list: without a dual-read window there
 * is no rotation, only a cutover that breaks every credential sealed before it. And because `/v1`
 * deliberately exposes no read-back path, nobody -- not even the control plane's own admin surface --
 * can export and re-seal, so a single-key cutover's only recovery is every user re-entering every
 * credential by hand. `seal` uses the FIRST key and `open` tries each, so rotation is: prepend the new
 * KEK, let writes re-seal forward, then drop the old one.
 *
 * The ring lives in the config rather than the wire form on purpose. A key id in the sealed value
 * would let `open` name the key it wanted instead of trying each, but it is also a format change, and
 * a format change is exactly what becomes a migration -- one needing the old KEK, which the no-read-
 * back rule forbids -- the moment the first credential is sealed. Try-each costs a few failed GCM
 * verifications on a ring of two and buys the rotation without one.
